title: Relinux 0.4 Prealpha 1 is done!
author: MiJyn

Yep, it's finished! It is not released because of licensing issues (which will be fixed by alpha 1),
but you can follow [this guide](https://github.com/MiJyn/relinux/wiki/Installing) to use it.

For any of you wondering, it's currently under GPLv2, but by alpha 1, it will be under LGPL :).

Features that are (somewhat) implemented:

 * GUI
 * Logging
 * OSWeaver (the part that _actually_ generates the ISO)
 * Module API

Please report any bugs you may encounter to [https://github.com/MiJyn/relinux/issues?milestone=1&state=open](https://github.com/MiJyn/relinux/issues?milestone=1&state=open).
